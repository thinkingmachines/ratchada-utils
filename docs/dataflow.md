# Data Flow Documentation
## Data Flow Overview
The data flow for the Ratchada Whisper Hugger project involves several stages from data ingestion to output. The following steps outline how data flows through the system:

### Data Ingestion

- **Component**: ratchada_utils.processor module
- **Description**: Data is ingested from various sources such as raw text files, web scraping, or APIs. This step involves gathering data, often including text, metadata (date, author), and other relevant information.
- **Differences Between Dev and Prod**: In development, the data source may be simulated or mocked to allow for rapid testing. In production, data is gathered from live, real-world sources.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Component**: process.py and basic.py in ratchada_utils.processor
- **Description**: The ingested data is cleaned and preprocessed. This involves tokenization, normalization, and transformation to prepare the data for evaluation or further processing. Preprocessing scripts handle tasks such as splitting text into tokens, removing unnecessary characters, and formatting data.
- **Differences Between Dev and Prod**: Preprocessing steps might be adjusted in development to test different scenarios, whereas production uses optimized configurations for efficiency and accuracy.

### Data Evaluation

- **Component**: evaluate_utils.py in ratchada_utils.evaluator
- **Description**: Evaluates the processed data to ensure it meets the required standards and performance metrics. This step includes comparing processed data against benchmarks or performing quality checks.
- **Differences Between Dev and Prod**: Evaluation criteria may be stricter in production, with thresholds set based on real-world performance requirements. Development evaluation may use looser criteria for easier debugging.
